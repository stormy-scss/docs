# Components module

The components module contains common components found in all websites. Currently it only contains buttons but it will contain Navbars, Footers, Sidebars, and other components. Each component will have a guide on using it that depends on certain classes being set, unlike other mixins in Stormy.

To use it, write `@use "stormy-scss/components" as stormy-components;` and start including the mixins by following the guide in the component page.
